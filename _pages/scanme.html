		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div>How can you best leverage the capabilities and affordances of augmented reality (generally defined, systems that augment rather than replace the physical world with digital objects) to allow individuals to develop their identity and express themselves?</div>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<div>SCANME is a smartphone-based app that allows people to use augmented reality to set a social digital status, tied to a real-world marker. Users can both communicate with their friends and <b>digitally augment their identity </b> to share with strangers in a way that echoes the laptop sticker.</div>

		<h2>Product</h2>
		<div>Our final result was a concept video and an MVP app running on Android devices. The app was built using  Vuforia and Unity, and prototypes were generated in Marvel.</div>

		<h1>Research</h1>

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<div>We began our design process with brainstorming and research on existing work in the space. After coming up with roughly a dozen ideas for personal expression with augmented reality, we became interested by the idea of a pop-up art gallery experience, facilitated by AR. Traditionally, the barrier to entry for someone to display their work in a gallery is quite high, both in terms of time and monetary cost. Using Google Cardboard or another cheap AR display, however, could allow someone to easily display images of their art or their favorite works. However, after needfinding with digital and installation artists and educators, we found that the limitations were greater than initially conceived. The scenery and setting of the gallery distracts viewers from the work; there is still financial overhead in getting enough smartphones, and the digital displays will likely be low fidelity.</div>
		<div>Thus, we decided to pivot on this idea, and stick with the core idea but transplanted to a simpler setting. Rather than creating curated augmented reality galleries, we switched to creating <b>curated augmented reality statuses</b>. Users could focus on sharing one piece of content at a time, with less demand for fidelity.</div>


		<h2>Market Analysis</h2>
		<div>After settling on a medium for curated AR statuses, we investigated existing media that people use to express themselves.</div>
		<div>There are many media for self-expression, both physical and digital. For this project, we defined 'media for self-expression' as platforms for transmitting images or words to other people. Some examples of physical self-expression media are clothing and tattoos; some examples of digital self-expression media are Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.</div>
		<div>In our preliminary research, we discovered that there is generally a tradeoff between <b>visibility</b> and <b>flexibility</b>. By visibility, we refer to the ease of access of content for a viewer. For example, tattoos can have high visibility (depending on location), because anyone in your vicinity can observe the content. By flexibility, we refer to the ability for a creator to change the content displayed through the medium. Tattoos have very low flexibility, for obvious reasons. Generally speaking, physical media have high visibility (readily accessible to all) but low flexibility, while digital media have low visibility (because they require knowledge of someone's digital names and use of the internet) but high flexibility (you can change your Facebook status as often as you'd like).</div>

		<h2>Task Analysis</h2>
		<div>After our research and brainstorming phase, we settled on a core concept for the app and user story. The above video illustrates the type of interaction we envisioned. We imagined a user's tasks as follows:
		</div>
		<div class="narrow-box">
		<div><b>0</b>) The user would place a unique "marker," over which the AR content would be overlaid when viewed, onto any surface they would like, as though it were a physical sticker. 
		</div>
		<div><b>1</b>) The user would select the digital content (scan) they would like viewers to see when they looked at the marker through their smartphone's camera in the app. Additionally, the app would allow searching for content in public repositories or uploading of original content.</div>
		<div><b>2</b>) The user could view another user's scan by opening the app and facing the camera over the user's sticker. The app's AR technology would then overlay the digital content.</div>
		<div><b>3</b>) The user could add another user as a friend and view their scans remotely.</div>
		</div>

		<h2>Design Tradeoffs</h2>
		<div><b>Privacy</b> was a concern in our design, as it often is with social media platforms. In particular, when interviewing potential users, they mentioned a concern for sharing any data and information publically, and being contacted by strangers that they didn't know. To address this, we allowed users to <b>share different content with friends and strangers at the same time</b>, leveraging the fact that the app could display different content for the same marker. Additionally, users would only be able to friend other users after scanning their sticker in person, which emphasizes the AR component of the project and narrows the funnel for friend requests.</div>
		<div><b>Accessibility</b>, in the sense of making the content readily viewable by non-users of the app, was another design challenge. It's well-known that people don't use QR codes because smartphones lack a default app or built-in feature for processing them. Although we couldn't directly combat this, we mitigated it by providing instructions in the design of the marker itself. Although each marker is customizable, we used pre-set colorful images with unusual patterns to both be readable by the computer vision algorithms and intriguing enough for non-users to learn more about SCANME.</div>

		<div>One novel challenge for this product was leveraging the <b>affordances</b> of augmented reality and traditional digital displays. In particular, AR allows for gesture-based interaction and situated content, whereas digital displays require touch-based interaction. For this project, we kept most of the interface in the 2D arena, except for viewing content at a location in space rather than loaded onto the user's screen. We chose not to have gesture-based interactions because we wanted to keep the UX as familiar as possible, and let users complete their tasks discreetly. For the future, we believe that combining these two modes of interaction will be a grand design challenge.</div>
