		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div>How can you best leverage the capabilities and affordances of augmented reality (generally defined, systems that augment rather than replace the physical world with digital objects) to allow individuals to develop their identity and express themselves?</div>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<div>SCANME is a smartphone-based app that allows people to use augmented reality to set a social digital status, tied to a real-world marker. Users can both communicate with their friends and digitally augment their identity to share with strangers in a way that echoes the laptop sticker.</div>
		<div>Our final deliverable was a concept video and Wizard-of-Oz application running on Android devices. Tools used included Vuforia and Unity.</div>

		<h1>Research</h1>

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<div>We began our design process with brainstorming and research on existing work in the space. After coming up with roughly a dozen ideas for personal expression with augmented reality, we became interested by the idea of a pop-up art gallery experience, facilitated by AR. Traditionally, the barrier to entry for someone to display their work in a gallery is quite high, both in terms of time and monetary cost. Using Google Cardboard or another cheap AR display, however, could allow someone to easily display images of their art or their favorite works. However, after needfinding with digital and installation artists and educators, we found that the limitations were greater than initially conceived. The scenery and setting of the gallery distracts viewers from the work; there is still financial overhead in getting enough smartphones, and the digital displays will likely be low fidelity.</div>
		<div>Thus, we decided to pivot on this idea, and stick with the core idea but transplanted to a simpler setting. Rather than creating curated augmented reality galleries, we switched to creating <b>curated augmented reality statuses</b>. Users could focus on sharing one piece of content at a time, with less demand for fidelity.</div>


		<h2>Market Analysis</h2>
		<div>Thus, after settling on a medium for curated AR statuses, we investigated existing media that people use to express themselves.</div>
		<div>There are many media for self-expression, both physical and digital. For this project, we defined 'media for self-expression' as platforms for transmitting images or words to other people. Some examples of physical self-expression media are clothing and tattoos; some examples of digital self-expression media are Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.</div>
		<div>In our preliminary research, we discovered that there is generally a tradeoff between <b>visibility</b> and <b>flexibility</b>. By visibility, we refer to the ease of access of content for a viewer. For example, tattoos can have high visibility (depending on location), because anyone in your vicinity can observe the content. By flexibility, we refer to the ability for a creator to change the content displayed through the medium. Tattoos have very low flexibility, for obvious reasons. Generally speaking, physical media have high visibility (readily accessible to all) but low flexibility, while digital media have low visibility (because they require knowledge of someone's digital names and use of the internet) but high flexibility (you can change your Facebook status as often as you'd like).</div>
