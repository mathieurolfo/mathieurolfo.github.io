		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div>How can you best leverage the capabilities and affordances of augmented reality (generally defined, systems that augment rather than replace the physical world with digital objects) to allow individuals to develop their identity and express themselves?</div>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<div>SCANME is a smartphone-based app that allows people to use augmented reality to set a social digital status, tied to a real-world marker. Users can both communicate with their friends and digitally augment their identity to share with strangers in a way that echoes the laptop sticker.</div>

		<h1>Research</h1>

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<div>We began our design process with brainstorming and research on existing work in the space. After coming up with roughly a dozen ideas for personal expression with augmented reality, we became interested by the idea of a pop-up art gallery experience, facilitated by AR.</div>


		<h2>Market Analysis</h2>
		<div>There are many media for self-expression, both physical and digital. For this project, we defined 'media for self-expression' as platforms for transmitting images or words to other people. Some examples of physical self-expression media are clothing and tattoos; some examples of digital self-expression media are Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.</div>
		<div>In our preliminary research, we discovered that there is generally a tradeoff between <b>visibility</b> and <b>flexibility</b>. By visibility, we refer to the ease of access of content for a viewer. For example, tattoos can have high visibility (depending on location), because anyone in your vicinity can observe the content. By flexibility, we refer to the ability for a creator to change the content displayed through the medium. Tattoos have very low flexibility, for obvious reasons. Generally speaking, physical media have high visibility (readily accessible to all) but low flexibility, while digital media have low visibility (because they require knowledge of someone's digital names and use of the internet) but high flexibility (you can change your Facebook status as often as you'd like).</div>
