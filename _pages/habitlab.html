		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div> People have bad online habits and make choices that are against their wishes and interests. How can we design a system that allows users to improve their digital behavior on websites more effectively than existing systems?</div>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<div>
		HabitLab tests whether experimentation with different techniques can produce behavior change, whether an adaptive algorithm can determine the best ones for you, and whether crowdsourcing can provide those techniques.
		</div>

		<h2>Product</h2>
		<div>When I joined the HabitLab project, several of the guiding principles had been developed and the Chrome extension back-end scaffolding had been built, but no interventions or user-facing features had actually been developed. My role was to complete the product lifecycle for interventions, from ideation to development. The project is a Chrome extension in beta, and still in development.</div>

		<h1>Research</h1>
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

		<div>There are a couple existing solutions in the marketplace that help internet users build better online habits, but all have limitations. RescueTime is an analytics extension/standalone application that tracks time spent on the computer to give users detailed reports about how they spent their time across apps and the web. StayFocusd is a popular browser extension that blocks access to websites after a certain time allowance is spent. SelfControl and Blocksite are two pieces of software that block websites irreversibly for a time period of the user's choice. And extensions like Kill News Feed, which removes the news feed from a user's Facebook page, make surgical changes to the UI of a particular site.

		<img class="project-img" src="{{site.url}}/files/stayfocusd.png"></img>
		<div class="picture-above">However, these methods are limited by their "one extension, one method" approach. Each tool has a single thesis about behavior change, and applies a single technique to the user. RescueTime attempts to display information and provide quantitative feedback, the site blockers take control out of the user's hands, and others make small changes on particular sites. However, there are no guarantees that their particular approach is most effective for a given user, as each user's motivational profile is different.</div>

		<h1>Concept</h1>
		<div>Rather than make users download different extensions and manually toggle between one-size-fits-all methods, Habitlab tries to discover the best interventions through experimentation and feedback. The thesis holds that giving people choice over the interventions they see, combined with objective usage data, will ultimately result in better retention and goal achievement.</div>
