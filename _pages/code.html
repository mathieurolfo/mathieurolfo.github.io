				{% include project.html type="code" title="Poetwriter" text="Poetwriter is a program that, given rhyme patterns and syllable constraints, generates poetry in the style of a specified artist. The project scraped lyrics for a given artist from Genius (though accepts any .txt file as input), trains an n-gram language model from the corpus, and generates rhyme pairs using a uniform-cost depth-first search with constraint matching within lines (for syllable count) and between lines (for rhyme patterns). The <a class='reg-link' href='https://github.com/ntindall/poetwriter'>poetwriter source code</a> is visible on Github." %}

				{% include project.html type="code" title="Where is the Lily?" text="Natural language is filled with instances where what you meant is more complex than what you literally said. For example, if you say ‘Some students were in class,‘ you probably don‘t mean ‘All students were in class‘ even though that is logically true. We attempted to discover if a computer program could pick up on these pragmatic nuances in the particular domain of spatial language (comparing the use of ‘inside‘ and ‘just inside‘). We conducted a Mechanical Turk experiment to get data on how people used spatial language in a specific context, and wrote a program that used the <a class='reg-link' href='http://gscontras.github.io/ESSLLI-2016/chapters/1-introduction.html'>rational speech act model</a>, i.e. recursive Bayesian inference, to learn these patterns. An <a class='reg-link' href='../../files/lilypaper.pdf'>academic writeup of Lily</a> and the <a class='reg-link' href='https://github.com/ntindall/reference_games'>Lily source code</a> are available." %}

				{% include project.html type="code" title="Pinterest Influencers" text="What predicts someone's influence in a social network? We explored this question using network analysis techniques on a nearly-billion-post subset of Pinterest. We first defined quantitative metrics of influence (repins-per-post and followers-of-followers), and calculated these metrics over the time period of a year on our graph. We then evaluated a variety of predictor metrics that were less computationally expensive to determine their predictive power. We found that prolificness, PageRank, and diversity score (a quantification of how distinct one's graph neighbors are) were the best predictors of influence. A longer <a class='reg-link'  href='https://github.com/dmakian/PinterestDiversity'>writeup of Pinterest influencer analysis</a> and the <a class='reg-link' href='../../files/pinterestpaper.pdf'>Pinterest influencer codebase</a> are available." %}
				
				{% include project.html type="code" title="Personal Website" text="<a class='reg-link' href='http://mathieurolfo.info'>mathieurolfo.info</a> was built mostly from scratch by me. It's statically generated using Jekyll, hosted with Github Pages, uses Liquid templating, and responsively designed. Eventually I might move to a server-hosted site if I want to add some cooler and more complex features, but for now simplicity is key. #meta" %}
