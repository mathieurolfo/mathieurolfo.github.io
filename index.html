	<div id="headline">Hi, I’m Mathieu! Welcome to my website.</div>

	<div> I’m a first-year master's student in computer science at Stanford University, class of 2018, concentrating in human computer interaction and artificial intelligence. I finished my undergrad at Stanford in Symbolic Systems (an interdisciplinary major combining psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science to try and understand cognition) in June 2016.
	</div>
	<div>I’m interested in well-designed products and experiences, helping people live more mindfully with technology, and bringing the physical and digital into symbiosis.</div>
	<div>You can check out projects I’ve done, organized by category:</div>
